## Hello friend. 🚀

I am Albina, a 17 year old dev. I have been a technology freak since I was 12 and I try to sometimes share stuff on GitHub

### 🤓 Current plans and projects I am working on:
- Homeworkit (a side project to make evaluations and homeworks easier for online schools)
- C/C++ Competitive Programming Exercises (sharing different algorithms and CP challenges)

### 🛠 Programming languages and technologies I play around with:
- C / C++ (Mainly for Competitive Programming)
- MERN Stack (To make web development sound fun)
- Amazon Web Services (Lambda, S3, Cognito, CloudFront, API Gateway)
- CSS and HTML (for engineering purposes)
- JavaScript
- Wordpress (because I'm good at web development)
